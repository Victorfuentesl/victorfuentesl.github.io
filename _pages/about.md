I am a first-year PhD candidate in Mathematics at the [Université de Bretagne-Occidentale (UBO)](https://www.univ-brest.fr), working under the guidance of [Prof. Eric Loubeau](https://www.univ-brest.fr/departement-mathematiques/fr/membre/eric-loubeau) and [Prof. Volker Branding](http://www.volker-branding.eu/). My research focuses on **Geometric Analysis**, **(pseudo-)Riemannian Geometry**, and **Mathematical General Relativity**. In particular, I am interested in constructing examples of biharmonic maps of degree 1 from the 2-torus to the 2-sphere.

I earned my MSc in Fundamental Mathematics from the Université de Rennes 1, where I completed my master’s thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Juan Souto](https://sites.google.com/site/jsoutoc/home), exploring classical comparison theorems in Riemannian Geometry.

I enjoy engaging with other researchers and students, and I welcome opportunities for collaboration on challenging problems in geometry and analysis. Don’t hesitate to get in touch!
