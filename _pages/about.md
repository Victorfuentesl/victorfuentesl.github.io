I am a first year PhD student in the [Fundamental AI (FunAI) Lab](https://fundamentalailab.github.io/) at the [University of Technology Nuremberg (UTN)](https://www.utn.de) under the supervision of [Prof. Yuki Asano](https://yukimasano.github.io/) and [Dr. Armand Joulin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/armand-joulin-0274254/).
My research interests mainly revolve around **Computer Vision**, **Multi-Modal Learning**, and **Efficient Deep Learning**. I am excited about developing innovative AI solutions that transcend theoretical boundaries and address tangible real-world challenges.

Previously, I obtained my MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Amsterdam. During my master's thesis, I got to work together with [Dr. Gertjan Burghouts](https://gertjanburghouts.github.io/) and [Prof. Serge Belongie](https://sergebelongie.github.io) as part of the [ELLIS MSc Honors Program](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/ellis/funding-opportunities/).

I’m always excited to connect and collaborate with fellow researchers and students - don’t hesitate to get in touch if you’d like to join forces on exciting AI projects!
