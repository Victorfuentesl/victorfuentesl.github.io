I am a first year PhD student in Mathematics at the [Université de Bretagne-Occidentale (UBO)](https://www.univ-brest.fr) under the supervision of [Prof. Eric Loubeau](https://www.univ-brest.fr/departement-mathematiques/fr/membre/eric-loubeau) and [Dr. Volker Branding](http://www.volker-branding.eu/).
My research interests mainly revolve around **Geometric Analysis**, **(pseudo-) Riemannian Geometry**, and **Mathematical General Relativity**. I am excited about developing examples for the existence of biharmonic maps of degree 1 from the 2-torus onto the 2-sphere.

Previously, I obtained my MSc in Fundamental Mathematics from the Université de Rennes 1. During my master's thesis, I got to work together with [Dr. Juan Souto](https://sites.google.com/site/jsoutoc/home) on [classical comparison theorems in Riemannian geometry](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NMo7R73wnayVPc__1KHmrQqrqbSumFK5/view?usp=sharing).

I’m always excited to connect and collaborate with fellow researchers and students - don’t hesitate to get in touch if you’d like to join forces on exciting geometrical/analytical projects!
